# STM32 Bare-Metal C Programming Resources  

This repository provides essential resources for learning **bare-metal programming** on STM32 microcontrollers. Bare-metal programming involves writing code directly for the hardware without using high-level abstractions like HAL or RTOS.  

## 📌 What You'll Learn  
- Understanding **STM32 architecture** and **Cortex-M** core.  
- Writing **low-level firmware** using **register-level programming**.  
- Configuring **GPIOs, Timers, UART, I2C, SPI**, and other peripherals.  
- Using **linker scripts, startup code, and interrupt handling**.  
- Debugging with **GDB, OpenOCD, and ST-Link**.  

## 📖 Resources Covered  
- STM32 programming manuals and reference guides.  
- Books and PDFs for in-depth learning.  
- Sample projects with **Makefile & CMake** setup.  
- Toolchain setup for **ARM GCC, OpenOCD, and ST-Link**.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Set up **ARM GCC toolchain**.  
2. Write a **startup file & linker script**.  
3. Configure **system clock & vector table**.  
4. Start with **basic GPIO programming**.  
5. Explore **peripherals and interrupts**.
