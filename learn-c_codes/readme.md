# Embedded Life

Welcome to  my **Embedded Life**! This folder provides is a beginner-friendly collection of **C** tutorial codes and small projects, just pure C goodness! offcourse for embedded system but you can still learn if not

Each folder includes C code, a short explanation, and sometimes a challenge to tweak or extend—learning happens in the doing.

## Getting Started
1. **Tools**: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC) and an editor (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks).
2. **Setup**: Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/embedded-life.git`.
3. **Run**: Open a day’s folder, compile with `gcc main.c -o output`, and run `./output`.

## Tips for the Journey
- Test your code line by line—bugs hide in plain sight.
- Start simple, build up, and don’t skip the basics.
- Life advice: Persistence beats frustration—keep coding, even when the output’s a mess.
